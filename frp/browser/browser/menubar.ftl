## Help Menu


# NOTE: For Engineers, any additions or changes to Help menu strings should
# also be reflected in the related strings in appmenu.ftl. Those strings, by
# convention, will have the same ID as these, but prefixed with "app".
# Example: appmenu-get-help
#
# These strings are duplicated to allow for different casing depending on
# where the strings appear.
