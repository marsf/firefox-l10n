# LOCALIZATION NOTE (fontinspector.customInstanceName): Think of instances as presets
# (groups of settings that apply in bulk to a thing). Instances have names. When the user
# creates a new instance, it doesn't have a name. This is the text that appears as the
# default name for a new instance. It shows up in a dropdown from which users can select
# between predefined instances and this custom instance.
