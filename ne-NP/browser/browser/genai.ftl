## Generative AI (GenAI) Settings section


## Chatbot prompts
## Prompts are plain language ‘instructions’ sent to a chatbot.
## These prompts have been made concise and direct in English because some chatbot providers
## have character restrictions and being direct reduces the chance for misinterpretation.
## When localizing, please be concise and direct, but not at the expense of losing meaning.

# This prompt is added to the beginning of selection prompts sent to a chatbot.
# $tabTitle (string) - title of the webpage
# $selection (string) - selected text
genai-prompt-prefix-selection = म "{ $selection }" चयन गरिएको पृष्ठ "{ $tabTitle }" मा छु।
