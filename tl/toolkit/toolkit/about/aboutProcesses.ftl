## Details within processes

# Thread details
# Variables:
#   $name (String) The name assigned to the thread.
#   $tid (String) The thread id of this thread, assigned by the OS.

# Tab
# Variables:
#   $name (String) The name of the tab (typically the title of the page, might be the url while the page is loading).
about-processes-tab-name = Tab: { $name }
about-processes-preloaded-tab = Preloaded New Tab
# Single subframe
# Variables:
#   $url (String) The full url of this subframe.
about-processes-frame-name-one = Subframe: { $url }
# Group of subframes
# Variables:
#   $number (Number) The number of subframes in this group. Always ≥ 1.
#   $shortUrl (String) The shared prefix for the subframes in the group.

## Displaying CPU (percentage and total)
## Variables:
##    $percent (Number) The percentage of CPU used by the process or thread.
##                      Always > 0, generally <= 200.
##    $total (Number) The amount of time used by the process or thread since
##                    its start.
##    $unit (String) The unit in which to display $total. See the definitions
##                   of `duration-unit-*`.

# Common case.
about-processes-cpu = { NUMBER($percent, maximumSignificantDigits: 2, style: "percent") }
    .title = Total CPU time: { NUMBER($total, maximumFractionDigits: 0) }{ $unit }
# Special case: process or thread is almost idle (using less than 0.1% of a CPU core).
# This case only occurs on Windows where the precision of the CPU times is low.

## Displaying Memory (total and delta)
## Variables:
##    $total (Number) The amount of memory currently used by the process.
##    $totalUnit (String) The unit in which to display $total. See the definitions
##                        of `memory-unit-*`.
##    $delta (Number) The absolute value of the amount of memory added recently.
##    $deltaSign (String) Either "+" if the amount of memory has increased
##                        or "-" if it has decreased.
##    $deltaUnit (String) The unit in which to display $delta. See the definitions
##                        of `memory-unit-*`.

# Common case.
about-processes-total-memory-size-changed = { NUMBER($total, maximumFractionDigits: 0) }{ $totalUnit }
